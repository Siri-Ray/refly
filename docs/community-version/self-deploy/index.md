# Self Deploy

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

To self-deploy Refly, you need to have the following installed:

- Docker (version 20.10.0 or higher)
- *Optional*: PostgreSQL client (either `psql` or GUI-based tools), used for managing usable LLM models
- *Optional*: Kubernetes cluster

::: info
We plan to provide a fully-functional native application in the future, offering seamless installation experience in a privacy-focused manner. Stay tuned!
:::

## Steps {#steps}

### 1. Clone the repository {#clone-the-repository}

```bash
git clone https://github.com/refly-ai/refly.git
```

::: tip
If you only need to deploy with Docker, you can add `--depth 1` to the `clone` command to save disk space and download time.
:::

### 2. Prepare the configuration via `.env` file {#prepare-the-configuration-via-env-file}

```bash
cd refly/deploy/docker
cp ../../apps/api/.env.example .env
```

::: info
A detailed description of all the environment variables is available in the [Configuration](../configuration.md).
:::

### 3. Start the application via docker compose {#start-the-application-via-docker-compose}

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

::: tip For passionate users
By default, the docker compose file will pull the `latest` image, which is the latest stable version. If you want to use the up-to-date version synced with the Refly Cloud, you can replace image tag `latest` with `nightly` in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
:::

You can run `docker ps` to check the status of the containers. The expected status for each container should be `Up` and `healthy`. An example output is shown below:

```bash

```

### Deploy to Kubernetes cluster

Apply deployment yaml file directory

```bash
cd refly/deploy/kubernetes
kubectl apply -f refly-deployment.yaml
```

Finally, you can access the Refly application in `http://${HOST_IP}:5700` (`http://${HOST_IP}:30001` in Kubernetes), where `${HOST_IP}` is the IP address of the host machine.

::: info
If you cannot access the Refly application, please check the following:

- The `HOST_IP` is correct.
- The application is running properly. If not, jump to [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).
- The port `5700`(`30001`) is not being blocked by any application firewall. Check this especially if you are using a cloud server.

## Upgrade Guide {#upgrade-guide}

To upgrade to the latest stable version, you can pull the latest image and restart the containers:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose down
docker compose up -d --remove-orphans
```

If you run into any issues, please refer to the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.

## Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

If the application fails to function properly, you can try the following steps:

1. Run `docker ps --filter name=refly_ | grep -v 'healthy'` to identify **unhealthy** containers (whose status is not `healthy`).
2. Run `docker logs <container_id>` to get more information about the unhealthy container.
3. If the unhealthy container is `refly_api`, you can first try to run `docker restart refly_api` to restart the container.
4. For others, you can search for the cause of error messages in the container's logs.

If the issue persists, you can raise an issue in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/refly-ai/refly/issues), or contact us in our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/bWjffrb89h).
